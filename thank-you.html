Thanks so much! Your interest has been recorded.

What I'm <b>really interested in</b> is getting connected with people who
can help get this project going.  That could be anyone involved in 
business, community or indigenous projects. Please take a look
at the <a href="details.html">project details</a> and you'll see what I mean.  There are several
ways to get this going.
</p>

<p>
