<h1 class="title">Details on Hydroponic Farming</h1>
<p>
I'm looking at a <a href="https://www.thegrowcer.ca">Growcer</a> a modular farm to produce fresh vegetables
for Grande Cache, Alberta. There are several potential ways we could do this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There is a "growcer story" about a Northern BC community called
<a href="https://www.thegrowcer.ca/featured-farmers/filling-a-community-need-valemount-learning-society">Valemount</a> (population 1,000) where a community group operates the unit.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thegrowcer.ca/featured-farmers/bountiful-harvests-muskoka-north-coop">There are</a> <a href="https://www.thegrowcer.ca/featured-farmers/improving-food-sovereignty-on-manitoulin-island-sheshegwaning-first-nation">several grower stories</a> <a href="https://www.thegrowcer.ca/featured-farmers/mnogin-greenhouse-empowering-food-sovereignty-and-economic-growth-in-nipissing-first-nation">where indigenous groups</a> own and operate they farm.</li>
<li>One growcer story <a href="https://www.thegrowcer.ca/featured-farmers/adding-agriculture-to-the-classroom-altario-school">features a Growcer owned and operated by a high school</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.thegrowcer.ca/featured-farmers/bountiful-harvests-muskoka-north-coop">pair of</a> <a href="https://www.thegrowcer.ca/featured-farmers/grocery-store-innovation-legacy-co-op">growcer stories</a> talk about local Co-op grocery stores operating these units.</li>
<li>Several stories feature private owners (often farms).</li>
<li>Many other stories here: <a href="https://www.thegrowcer.ca/featured-farmers">https://www.thegrowcer.ca/featured-farmers</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Whatever the model, they must answer these important questions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Where will the funds come from (We need ~ $200,000 CAD; Government of Canada, AB, Grande Cache has grants&#x2026;).</li>
<li>Where will we put it?</li>
<li>Who will provide the ~25 hours a week of operating labour?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Planting seedlings</li>
<li>Harvesting Crops</li>
<li>Making deliveries</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

Right now I have no real leads on this. I'm investigating all the realistic ownership models, but I don't have
a lot of community contacts. If you're interested in putting me in touch with the right people, please reach out to me (Warren Wilkinson) at
<a href="mailto:warrenwilkinson@gmail.com">warrenwilkinson@gmail.com</a> or call/text me at 587-926-3145.

<p>
These are the potential ownership models, so there is obviously a lot
of people I could be talking too about any one of them.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>As a personal private business</li>
<li>As a sub-entity of the grocery store</li>
<li>A community group
a. A newly founded one
b. Growing Empowered
c. The Farmers Market
d. Some other group</li>
<li>As a kind of High-School / Library model farm.</li>
<li>As some kind of municipal creation</li>
<li>As a business owned and operated by one of the residential co-ops.</li>
<li>As a project run by a consortium of businesses (e.g. restaurants, grocery stores, farmers market).</li>
</ol>
